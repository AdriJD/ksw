The hyperspherical.c routine and its dependencies extracted from the CLASS boltzmann code. The code is used for efficient interpolation of spherical bessel functions. This code can also produce hyperspherical bessel functions (generalizations of the spherical bessel functions useful for cosmologies with spatial curvature) but we do not use them. For details on the implementation see Thomas Tram, Commun. Comput. Phys. 22, 2017.
