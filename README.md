### Installation

```
make
```

```
pip install .
```

Run tests:

```
make check
```

Consider adding the `-e` flag to the `pip install` command to enable automatic 
updating of code changes when developing.

As an alternative to the `pip install .` command, you can run:

```
make python
```

to simply build the python package inside this directory.
